/*Provide the definition for each of the following structures and unions:
a) Structure inventory containing character array partName[30], integer partNumber,
floating-point price, integer stock and integer reorder.
b) Union data containing char c, short s, long b, float f and double d.
c) A structure called address that contains character arrays
streetAddress[25], city[20], state[3] and zipCode[6].
d) Structure student that contains arrays firstName[15] and
lastName[15] and variable homeAddress of type struct address from part (c).
e) Structure test containing 16 bit fields with widths of 1 bit. The names of the bit fields
are the letters a to p.*/
